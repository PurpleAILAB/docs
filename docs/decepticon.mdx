# Decepticon
As agents become more sophisticated, attackers evolve accordingly.
From AI-driven phishing to self-learning malware, offensive techniques are becoming increasingly automated and intelligent.

To effectively defend against AI-powered threats, we must act faster—and we must act first.
Decepticon is designed for that very purpose: using AI agents to automate red teaming before attackers automate theirs.

Built on the robust foundation of LangChain/LangGraph, Decepticon grows alongside the thriving AI agent ecosystem. By leveraging the same cutting-edge frameworks that power the future of AI, we ensure compatibility, scalability, and continuous innovation through community collaboration.

Delegate repetitive and manual tasks to agents, and focus on intuition and decision-making to fulfill the true essence of a CyberSecurity Supervisor.


## Vision

> *Prepare before AI hacks first.*

As AI agents become more sophisticated, attackers evolve accordingly. From AI-driven phishing to self-learning malware, offensive techniques are becoming increasingly automated and intelligent.

To effectively defend against AI-powered threats, **we must act faster** — and **we must act first**.

**Decepticon** is designed for that purpose: using AI agents to automate red teaming before attackers automate theirs.

### What is Vibe Hacking?

**Vibe Hacking** is a new paradigm in Offensive Security defined by PurpleAILAB.

Unlike traditional red teaming methods that rely on manual execution, **AI agents autonomously perform red teaming tasks** in Vibe Hacking.

> *The Best Defense is a Good Offense.*
