# Vision

> _Prepare before AI hacks first._

As AI agents become more sophisticated, attackers evolve accordingly. From AI-driven phishing to self-learning malware, offensive techniques are becoming increasingly automated and intelligent.

To effectively defend against AI-powered threats, **we must act faster** — and **we must act first**.

**Decepticon** is designed for that purpose: using AI agents to automate red teaming before attackers automate theirs.

### What is Vibe Hacking?

**Vibe Hacking** is a new paradigm in Offensive Security defined by PurpleAILAB.

Unlike traditional red teaming methods that rely on manual execution, **AI agents autonomously perform red teaming tasks** in Vibe Hacking.

> _The Best Defense is a Good Offense._
