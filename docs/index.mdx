# What is Red Team?

<Warning>
  This page explains the concept of Red Team testing and how Decepticon approaches it.

## The Difference: Red Team vs Penetration Testing

### Penetration Testing (PenTest)

Traditional penetration testing focuses on finding vulnerabilities in specific areas:

- Web applications
- Mobile applications
- Cloud infrastructure
- Network

**Characteristics:**
- Sequential attacks (web → mobile → network)
- Isolated assessments
- Focus on individual vulnerabilities
- Short duration (days)

### Red Team

Red Team testing emulates real attackers to evaluate the **entire security posture** of an organization:

- Simultaneous attacks across all attack surfaces
- Tests Blue Team's detection and response capabilities
- Evaluates people, processes, and technology together
- Long-term engagement (4-8 weeks)

## Red Team Attack Lifecycle

```
1. Infrastructure   - Build attack infrastructure
2. Initial Recon    - OSINT, external asset discovery
3. Initial Access   - Phishing, vulnerabilities, physical
4. Foothold        - Establish persistent access
5. Priv Esc        - Escalate privileges
6. Lateral Move    - Move through network
7. Persistence      - Maintain access
8. Mission          - Achieve objectives
```

## Why Red Team Matters

### The Problem with Traditional Testing

Finding 10 XSS vulnerabilities doesn't tell you:
- How your team responds to a real attack
- If your security controls work together
- Whether lateral movement would be detected
- How quickly your Blue Team reacts

### Red Team Provides

- **Realistic scenarios** - Not just vulnerability finding
- **Team evaluation** - Tests people, process, and technology
- **Continuous assessment** - 4-8 weeks of ongoing operations
- **Detection improvement** - Helps Blue Team get better

## Decepticon's Approach

Decepticon is designed to help organizations conduct **autonomous Red Team testing**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| AI-Powered | Autonomous agents that can plan and execute attacks |
| Full Coverage | Tests across web, cloud, network, and more |
| RoE Enforcement | Safety guardrails to prevent unintended damage |
| Subscription-Based | Use your existing LLM subscriptions |

<Warning>
  Red Team testing should only be conducted with proper authorization. Always establish clear Rules of Engagement (RoE) before testing.
