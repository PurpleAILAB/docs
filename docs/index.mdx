# Decepticon

<Warning>
  This project is in early development (experimental). APIs and architecture may change.
</Warning>

## Vision

> **"Prepare before AI hacks first."**

As AI agents become more sophisticated, attackers evolve accordingly. From AI-driven phishing to self-learning malware, offensive techniques are becoming increasingly automated and intelligent.

To effectively defend against AI-powered threats, **we must act faster** — and **we must act first**.

**Decepticon** is designed for that purpose: using AI agents to automate red teaming before attackers automate theirs.

### What is Vibe Hacking?

**Vibe Hacking** is a new paradigm in Offensive Security defined by PurpleAILAB.

Unlike traditional red teaming methods that rely on manual execution, **AI agents autonomously perform red teaming tasks** in Vibe Hacking.

> *The Best Defense is a Good Offense.*

## Current Status

Decepticon is currently in **experimental phase**:

|-----------|--------|
| Core Framework | ⚠️ Experimental |
| CLI Interface | ✅ Working |
| Web Interface | ⚠️ Streamlit (temporary) |
| Red Team Agents | 🔄 In Development |
| Multi-Agent System | 🔄 Planning |
