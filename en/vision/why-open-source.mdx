description: "Decepticon's open source model goes beyond code—it's about building collective intelligence for the security ecosystem."

Open-sourcing a hacking agent is not a casual decision. This page explains why Decepticon's open-source model is fundamentally different from "just publishing code on GitHub"—and why collective intelligence is the only way to win the cybersecurity arms race.

## Beyond Traditional Open Source

Most open-source security tools follow a familiar pattern: the code is public, developers can clone it, run it locally, maybe submit a bug fix. It's a **tool** you download and use.

Decepticon aspires to something fundamentally different.

    Code is public. Fork it, use it locally, maybe file an issue. The project stays a **tool**.

    Code, knowledge, ideas, and real-world experience flow in all directions. The project becomes an **ecosystem**.

## Collective Intelligence

In Decepticon's world, "contribution" means far more than pull requests:

*   **Code Contributions**: Reviews, feature PRs, bug fixes—the traditional open-source workflow. Absolutely welcome.
*   **Knowledge Archiving**: Red Team techniques, attack methodologies, defense bypass strategies—documented and shared for the community.
*   **Real-World Experience**: War stories from actual engagements. What worked, what didn't, what surprised you.
*   **Simple Ideas**: Even a rough sketch of an attack concept or a "what if we tried..." suggestion has value. Not every contribution needs to be polished code.
*   **Feedback Loops**: Using Decepticon against your own infrastructure and sharing what you learned—both offensively and defensively.

  The security industry has a wealth of practical knowledge locked inside individual teams and closed-door engagements. Decepticon's community aims to surface that knowledge and make it collectively actionable.

## Blue Team vs. Red Team: A Living Community

This is not just a Red Team project. The ultimate purpose of Decepticon is to strengthen **defense**.

We envision a community where both sides of the security equation participate actively:

*   🔴 **Red Teamers** share attack patterns, evasion techniques, and creative exploitation chains.
*   🔵 **Blue Teamers** share detection strategies, incident response playbooks, and lessons from real encounters.
*   🟣 **Together**, the community creates a feedback loop that mirrors what Decepticon itself does: infinite, iterative improvement.

In the security industry, **practical, real-world discussions** are invaluable. The gap between academic research and what actually happens during an engagement is enormous. A community that bridges this gap benefits everyone—except the actual threat actors.

## The Bigger Picture

Here's the truth that most "offensive AI" projects miss:

> There are already many offensive AI agents. The world doesn't need another "look, AI can hack things!" demo.

What the world needs is a system that turns offensive capabilities into **defensive evolution**. Decepticon is the **first step** in building that system.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Offensive Agent">
    Build a world-class Vibe Hacking Agent that simulates realistic Red Team operations. **← We are here.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Infinite Feedback">
    Deploy the agent to generate continuous, diverse attack scenarios against target infrastructure—creating an endless stream of offensive feedback.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Defensive Evolution">
    Channel that feedback into Blue Team capabilities: detection rules, response playbooks, hardening strategies. The defense evolves because the offense never stops.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Decepticon is not the destination. It's the engine that powers the journey toward **impenetrable defense**.

## A Note on Responsibility

With the power of an autonomous offensive agent comes the responsibility to ensure it is used ethically.

Red Team Testing in the real world requires **agreement**—a formal consensus between all parties before any operation begins. The scope, targets, timing, and boundaries must be clearly defined and mutually agreed upon. This is not optional; it is the foundation of ethical offensive security.

<Warning>
  Decepticon is a powerful tool that can be misused. We take this seriously. The project includes Rules of Engagement (RoE) enforcement that defines operational boundaries—but more importantly, we rely on the community's commitment to ethical use and the principle that **offense exists to serve defense**.
</Warning>

Just as real Red Team engagements begin with a formal agreement, every Decepticon operation should begin with clear intent, defined scope, and proper authorization.
