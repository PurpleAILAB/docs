Decepticon is not built on a whim. Every architectural decision stems from a set of core beliefs forged through years of research, failures, and hard-earned insights. This page outlines the philosophical pillars that define what Decepticon is—and what it deliberately is not.

## Reasoning Over Signatures

Traditional security tools operate on a **signature-based** paradigm: databases of known vulnerabilities (CVEs), known malicious payloads, and known attack patterns. If an attack doesn't match a signature, it slips through undetected.

<Warning>
  The most dangerous vulnerabilities in production systems are almost never in a CVE database. They are **logical flaws**—unique to the target's business logic, architecture, and the assumptions humans made when building it.
</Warning>

Decepticon rejects the signature-first approach. Instead of pattern-matching against a static database, it **reasons** about the target:

*   **Contextual Understanding**: It reads server responses, understands application flow, and identifies where human assumptions create exploitable gaps.
*   **Dynamic Strategy**: Instead of running the same scan playbook every time, it adapts its approach based on the unique "vibe" of each target environment.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Attacks**: It constructs multi-step attack chains, where each step informs the next—just like a real human attacker would.

## Hybrid Intelligence

Decepticon is **not** about replacing proven security tools with AI. It's about combining them intelligently.

The cybersecurity field has decades of battle-tested techniques: fuzzing, static analysis, network scanning, payload mutation. These tools are powerful within their domains. But they lack the ability to **reason**, **adapt**, and **connect the dots** across multiple attack surfaces.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Decepticon's approach is to let each do what it does best:

*   **Fuzzers** generate thousands of malformed inputs faster than any LLM could.
*   **Scanners** enumerate services and known vulnerabilities with mechanical precision.
*   **The Agent** decides *when* to deploy these tools, *interprets* their results, *chains* them into meaningful attack sequences, and *pivots* when the situation changes.

This is **Hybrid Intelligence**: the precision of automation guided by the reasoning of an AI agent.

## The Offensive Vaccine

As discussed in the [Overview](/en/introduction/overview#the-motivation-an-offensive-vaccine), Decepticon's ultimate goal is not to attack—it is to **immunize**.

<Info>
  Just as a biological vaccine exposes the body to weakened pathogens to build immunity, Decepticon exposes your infrastructure to relentless AI-driven attacks to build resilience.
</Info>

But here's what makes this different from "just another scanner":

1.  **Infinite Feedback Loop**: The agent generates an endless stream of diverse, context-aware attack scenarios—never repeating the same playbook.
2.  **Realistic Threat Simulation**: To be an effective vaccine, attacks must mirror real-world threat actors. A tool that loudly port-scans and checks for default credentials is not a vaccine; it's a placebo.
3.  **Measurable Evolution**: Every cycle of attack and defense produces measurable data, allowing the Blue Team to quantify their improvement over time.

## Human in the Loop

Autonomous does not mean unsupervised. Decepticon places the **human operator as the ultimate authority**—the true decision-maker and intelligence behind the operation.

The agent operates autonomously, executing its strategies and adapting in real-time. But the human is always present:

*   **Real-Time Monitoring**: Like modern AI agent services, operators can watch the agent's actions as they happen—seeing what it's doing, why it's doing it, and what it plans to do next.
*   **Intervention at Any Time**: The operator can pause, redirect, or override the agent's decisions at any moment. The agent is the tool; the human is the strategist.
*   **Feedback-Driven Learning**: Human feedback shapes the agent's behavior. The operator isn't just watching—they're actively refining the operation.

<Tip>
  Think of it like a self-driving car: it handles the driving, but the human can take the wheel at any moment. The human doesn't need to steer every turn, but they are always in control.
</Tip>

## Stealth as Foundation

Most automated security tools are inherently **noisy**. They blast thousands of requests, trigger every SIEM rule, and announce their presence to anyone watching.

This completely defeats the purpose of Red Team Testing. The whole point is to test whether the Blue Team can **detect** a sophisticated adversary. If your testing tool sets off every alarm the moment it starts, you're not testing detection—you're testing alert fatigue.

Decepticon treats stealth as a **foundational design requirement**:

*   **C2-Based Operations**: The agent operates through Command & Control infrastructure—just like a real threat actor—maintaining encrypted, covert communication channels.
*   **Sandbox Execution**: Commands are executed within sandboxed environments, mimicking the operational security practices of actual adversaries.
*   **Low-and-Slow**: Activity is throttled and timed to blend with normal traffic patterns, not to overwhelm defenses with volume.

The value is not just finding vulnerabilities. It's answering the critical questions: *Can the Blue Team detect us? How fast do they respond? What do they miss?*
