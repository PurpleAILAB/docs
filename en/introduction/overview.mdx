Welcome to the **Decepticon** documentation. 

<Note>
  This documentation serves as a living record of the thoughts, vision, and architectural direction behind Decepticon prior to its major refactoring phase.
</Note>

## What is Decepticon?

Decepticon is **not** a traditional vulnerability scanner or a standard pentesting tool. It is an autonomous **Vibe Hacking Agent** built strictly for **Red Team Testing**. 

While generic tools rely on static checklists to find outdated software, real-world attackers simulate unpredictable, context-aware attacks. Decepticon embraces this attacker mindset, acting autonomously to discover deep, logical, and context-based vulnerabilities (the "vibe" of the target).

## The Motivation: An Offensive Vaccine

Why are we building a relentless, AI-powered hacking agent?

<Info>
  **The ultimate goal of Decepticon is not to attack, but to build an impenetrable defense.**
</Info>

In today's cybersecurity landscape, malicious threat actors are already leveraging AI to scale and automate their attacks. A project initiated 7 months ago has already proven that AI-driven offensive capabilities are not a future hypothesis—they are a reality right now. 

To counter an AI, you need an AI. We cannot defend against infinite, machine-speed attacks using traditional human-speed defenses. 

Decepticon exists to provide **infinite offensive feedback**. By deploying this Vibe Hacking Agent against our own systems, we subject ourselves to continuous, relentless attack scenarios. It acts as an **Offensive Vaccine**: 

*   **Inoculation**: By absorbing infinite AI attacks in a controlled environment, we expose blind spots and logical flaws.
*   **Evolution**: We force our defensive infrastructure to evolve into a vastly more robust state *before* real, malicious actors can strike.
